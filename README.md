# directory-worm

# Introduction
directory-worm is a python written script that tarverses through all the directories in the drive it runs from, and implants worm.py in each directory which subsequently spreads itself out through the current working directory and a directory one level above it. To run it, user must click on run.py, which would then ask for UAC permission to run as administrator.

# Disclaimer
This project was written for educational purposes only. Although it is a simple script that may not be as affective as the famous one. PLEASE do not run it unless you're doing it under a test environment. The script has yet to be tested however and was written without any actual runs.
